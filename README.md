# Citizen Service Requests (Requests 311) - SOEN 691 Project

*Citizen service requests(Requests 311)* are the requests for services submitted to the City of Montreal via the 311 call system, by email and at the Access Montreal Offices (BAM). These requests are categorized into 3,

* Requests
* Complaints 
* Comments

Kind of questions to answer:

1. Any notable trends in location or volume of certain calls?
2. Analyze the most common complaints of the major locations which demand service often.
3. Can you predict future 311 calls?
4. Provide interesting analytical data to predict future resource allocation by policymakers.
5. What are some effective visualizations for conveying 311 incidences and trends?
6. How do 311 requests vary by neighborhood? or source? Overtime or seasonally?
7. What attributes have the greatest effect on how long it takes a case to close?
8. Is there a way to identify duplicative reports (when multiple people create a 311 report for the same incidence)

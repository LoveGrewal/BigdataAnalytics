# Citizen Service Requests (Requests 311) - SOEN 691 Project

3-1-1 is a special telephone number supported in many communities in Canada and the United States. The number provides access to non-emergency municipal services. Here in this project, we are trying to analyse New York City’s(The largest 3-1-1 Operation in North America). We are using data from 1st January 2018 to 31st January 2020. By analyzing the data, we are trying to answer questions like, “*The most frequent complaints reported*”, “*Average time to resolve the complaint/issue*”, “*How do 311 requests vary by neighborhood? or source? Over time or seasonally?*”, “*Agency wise complaint distribution*”
